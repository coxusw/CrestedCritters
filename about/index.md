Crested Critters provides premium isopods, botanicals, and accessories designed to support thriving bioactive enclosures.

## What we focus on

* Healthy cultures and enclosure-safe materials  
* Clear inventory + fast updates  
* Supplies built for real keepers



### Do you ship isopods or springtails?

**Currently, Crested Critters does not ship live isopods or springtails.** At this time, all isopods and springtails are available for **in-person purchase only within the Northwest Indiana region.** We do have plans to offer shipping in the future once we are confident we can maintain the same high standards of animal health and safe delivery.

### Do you ship other items?

Yes. Non-live items such as botanicals and 3D printed accessories may be shipped. All shipments are sent through **USPS Ground Advantage** unless otherwise specified. Processing times may vary depending on product availability and preparation requirements.

### What is your live arrival / DOA policy?

Because live isopods and springtails are currently sold **in person only**, live arrival issues related to shipping do not apply at this time. When live shipping becomes available in the future, Crested Critters will implement a clear and fair live arrival guarantee to ensure customer confidence and animal welfare.

### What is your return policy?

Crested Critters generally does **not offer returns**, and all sales are considered final. However, we stand behind the quality of our products and customer experience.

If you believe there is an issue with your purchase, we encourage you to **reach out through the Contact page.** We review each situation individually and will make every reasonable effort to resolve legitimate concerns fairly.

What is Crested Critters’ overall policy philosophy?

Our goal is to provide healthy cultures, high-quality supplies, and an honest buying experience. We take pride in our products and our reputation within the hobby community. If a problem arises, we are committed to working with you in good faith to find an appropriate solution.
